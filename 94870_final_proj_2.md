# Story Development

I have implemented some changes as follows:

1. The title 'Green money is Good money' is replaced with **'Responsible money is Good money'**. This better represents my intention to cover ESG investment generally, rather then focusing on the "E(environment)" part.
2. The audience of my is now decided as *'People who are intersted in both **investment** & **public good**'*
3. Developing a storyline:

> I thought it would be good to start off with about 'making some money', since things like this may attract the audience's attention. Who'd not like to earn money?
> Instead of going too deep about 'what is ESG investing' or 'what is an ETF', I came up with a visualization (not data!) that shows the vanilla funds and the ESG twins.
> I assume the audience will be familiar with Exchange-traded Funds(ETF) and its three-letter-codes.
> After presenting the comparison data, I will also append that the whole ESG investment notion is getting smaller rapidly.
> My call for action will be *'Please invest more on ESG funds! It's good for you and everyone else!'*

# Wireframing with *Shorthand*

I drafted the final product with Shorthand, and am planning to keep this mode of delivery.
