# Story Development

I have implemented some changes as follows:

1. The title 'Green money is Good money' is replaced with **'Responsible money is Good money'**. This better represents my intention to cover ESG investment generally, rather then focusing on the "E(environment)" part.
2. The audience of my is now decided as *'People who are intersted in both **investment** & **public good**'*
3. Developing a storyline:

- I thought it would be good to start off with about 'making some money', since things like this may attract the audience's attention. Who'd not like to earn money?
- Instead of going too deep about 'what is ESG investing' or 'what is an ETF', I came up with a visualization (not data!) that shows the vanilla funds and the ESG twins.
- I assume the audience will be familiar with Exchange-traded Funds(ETF) and its three-letter-codes.
- After presenting the comparison data, I will also append that the whole ESG investment notion is getting smaller rapidly.
- My call for action will be *'Please invest more on ESG funds! It's good for you and everyone else!'*

### Wireframing with *Shorthand*

I drafted the final product with *Shorthand*, and am planning to keep this mode of delivery.

I also used *Tableau* as the main software for data visualization, and one set of image from Powerpoint(not data!). 

# User Research

## Tester A: Late 10s, female, college student, industrial enginneering
### Experience in personal investment: 1 years

Is the author's intention and call for action clearly understandable? (1~5)
> 3, The later half may need some more information.

Are the visualizations clear, aesthetic, and understandable? (1~5)
> 5, Interactivity is fascinating, but not sure if necessary. I like the black background.

Do You have any suggestions to improve the product?
> You may need a professional-looking color scheme.
> You may need a more precise story of pursuation.

## Tester B: Late 20s, male, doctoral student, statistics
### Experience in personal investment: 3 years

Is the author's intention and call for action clearly understandable? (1~5)
> 4, You need to explain more about ESG itself.

Are the visualizations clear, aesthetic, and understandable? (1~5)
> 4, Whatever you're building should blend in the background and be similar with the other graphs.

Do You have any suggestions to improve the product?
> Utilizing the embedded HTML, it would be better if you have a horizontal scrollbar that you can actively see the earnings given that you invested a certain amount of money on a certain date.
> There are too many photos in the background. It may distract people. "Tone-down" a bit.

## Tester C: (age unknown), female, masters student
### Experience in personal investment: professional work experience in an alternative invstment-related NGO

Are the visualizations clear, aesthetic, and understandable?
> The line in your graph is to thin.

Do You have any suggestions to improve the product?
> You might want to mention "alternative investing" in addition to 'ESG': such as XXXXXXX (website, personally identifiable information)

# Things to fix based on feedback

1. A 'simple' set of colors as a background? Applying background photos with the same filters everywhere seems possible, unsure if it's a good idea.
2. Horizontal bar? I would have to do some research to see if that is even feasible.
