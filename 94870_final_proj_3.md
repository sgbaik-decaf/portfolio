# Development

## Abstract

### Intended audience

1. People who are interested in financial investment
2. People who are interested in business ethics

### Thesis
- ESG investment incorporates the Environmental, Social, and Governance ethics of business into its fiduaciary aspects.
- ESG investment also incorporates the personal values of stakeholders(consumers, employees, etc.) into business.
- Some ESG-oriented financial products have been outperforming 'vanilla' products.
- The size ESG investment had been steeadily growing pre-COVID.
- Relating to the current political polarization and social conflict, the size of ESG investment is steeply shrinking.
- All consumers, as a major stakeholder of businesses, must:
1. Be a critical consumer, an active auditer of business ethics.
2. Share one's value, which is an imperative index to future performance.

## Major feedback and improvements

> I would include a disclaimer somewhere on here to ... the story shouldn't be taken as financial investment advice.

> Where are you settled in terms of the audience, and what you were really hoping to learn from the protocol? 

I recently realized a financial advice isn't exactly legal. There was a major reconstruction of storytelling and structurizing.

The initial plan to make a call for action of *'Please invest more on ESG funds! Itâ€™s good for you and everyone else!'* has been completely scrapped.

Also, the intended audience has been adjusted from *'People who are intersted in both investment & public good'* to a more general population as above.

I added a chunk of text information about ESG itself, to completely reorient the product with an emphasis from a policy standpoint.

Also, I have not expanded *financial outperformance of ESG funds* part, and left it as it is from Part 2. No major data analysis was added from Part 2.

In the conclusion part, I related the current socio-political landscape of aggression and polarization (i.e. anti political correctness) with financial backlash to ESG,.

Analytical references on *Forbes* and *Fortune* about this matter are included in the product.

I suspect there to be some kind of a significant correlation with COVID too, but I have intentionally skipped this to keep everything straight and simple as possible.

The call for action was also designed to reflect the socio-political aspect of ESG investment, over the financial aspect.

> You may need a professional-looking color scheme. You may need a more precise story of pursuation.

I tried to minimize the use of colors.

I tried used blue and green as highlight colors, and black as background.

Due to the use of multiple stock images(*Unsplash*) and limitations of the platform(*Shorthand*) (also, my shortage of experience, apprently), I was not able to fully control colors.

Over setting a color scheme, maintaining text readability was my priority.

> Utilizing the embedded HTML, it would be better if you have a horizontal scrollbar that you can actively see the earnings given that you invested a certain amount of money on a certain date.

This was the most impressive recommendation, but it technically was not feasible within limoted timeframe.
