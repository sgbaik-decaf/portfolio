## Abstract

### Intended audience

1. People who are interested in financial investment
2. People who are interested in business ethics

### Thesis
- ESG investment incorporates the Environmental, Social, and Governance ethics of business into its fiduaciary aspects.
- ESG investment also incorporates the personal values of stakeholders(consumers, employees, etc.) into business.
- Some ESG-oriented financial products have been outperforming 'vanilla' products, making ESG investment a mainstream notion while disseminating the notion of corporate social responsibility.
- Recently, the size of ESG investment is shrinking.
- All consumers, as a major stakeholder of businesses, must:
1. Be a critical consumer, an active auditer
2. Share their value, which is an imperative index to business ethics.
