## Green money is Good money

The role and responsibility of a business corporate has been a big issue for a few years.

A corporate's social responsibility(CSR) is now commonly abstracted as environnmental, social, and governance factors(ESG).

Corporate ESG is increasingly being financially material as massive reorientation of funds have been made in ESG investments.

The goal of this project is to visually compare the up-to-date financial `return` of two dominant sets of exchange traded funds(ETF) of US and its counterpart as a relative `beta`.

Select ETFs are:

Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF(`QQQM`) vs Invesco ESG NASDAQ 100 ETF(`QQMG`) & Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(`VOO`) vs iShares ESG Screened S&P 500 ETF(`XVV`)

From inception to Dec 31, 2023; both sets of ETFs showed a relative `beta` of about 1.04, which means that ESG ETFs made about 4% more investment return.

`QQMG` and `XVV` are both passive funds, meaning that corporates with a firm ESG compliance is more likely to perform better than ones that don't. 

## Data Source

All data is from the *Historical Data* page of [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/historical).

Data will be prepped via Microsoft Excel and/or Visual Studio Code.

## Medium

A draft of the visualization has been developed via Tableau.

The plan is to use Shorthand to build an aesthetic website along with some short, impressive notes about the financial implications of corporate ESG and the main visualization.

I am open for various options for building the visualization that suits well with Shorthand: I need more customization.
