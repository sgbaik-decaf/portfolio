# Multiple Regression with Statistical Inference

This work is a snippet reconstructed from an academic coursework 90-711 *Statistical Reasoning with R* at Carnegie Mellon University.

The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration between 1994 and 1998 was designed to test whether offering housing vouchers and/or financial assistance for families in high-poverty neighborhoods to move to low-poverty neighborhoods could lead to better experiences. I used the *R Tidyverse* package and the corresponding data to perform an exploratory data analysis(EDA) and multiple regression with statistical inference  The effectiveness of a specific policy intervention was examined.

This exercise was based on the following article:

Ludwig, J., Duncan, G.J., Gennetian, L.A., Katz, L.F., Kessler, J.R.K., and Sanbonmatsu, L., 2012. "[Neighborhood Effects on the Long-Term Well-Being of Low-Income Adults](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1224648)." *Science*, Vol. 337, Issue 6101, pp. 1505-1510.
